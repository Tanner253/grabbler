Place your audio file here named: annoying-track.mp3

The audio should be:
- Looping (the game will handle this automatically)
- An annoying/greedy sound (e.g., greedy laughter, alarm, etc.)
- MP3 format for best browser compatibility

The file will be referenced in the game as: /audio/annoying-track.mp3

Until you add the file, the game will work but audio won't play (you'll see a console error which is expected).
